## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Centered the profile card similarly with the previous challenge with flexbox. Used gap instead of padding/margin for the profile links.


```css
.profile-card-links {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to try and utilize transition more in future projects for hover effects and gradient/color changes.
